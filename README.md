<h1>ABB RAPID UTILITY LIBRARY</h1>

<h2>A collection of utility modules for ABB industrial robots.</h2>

The purpose of this repo is to create a takeaway library for everyone to use in their robot programming projects.

<h3>Syntax highlighter</h3>
Added a new definitionfile for ABB Rapid IRC5 to use with UltraEdit & UEStudio. I could only find the S4 definition on the internet, and it was not a very good one, so I made this new version that covers IRC5. It also finds the functions & traps, and prints the arguments in the functionlist. Also the most common arguments, switches, speeds, zones and more are shown in a different color.

<h3>Help</h3>
If you like to contribute to this library, please send what you got to my email, and I will add it to the collection. Dont forget to write a module header like the one in TIMER.mod. Use the LICENSE-TEMPLATE.txt. The code should be readable, nice and tidy.
