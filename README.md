ABB_RAPID_UTILITIES
===================

A collection of utility modules for ABB industrial robots.

The purpose of this repo is to create a takeaway library 
for everyone to use in their robot programming projects.

If you like to contribute to this repo, please send what you 
got to my email, and I will add it to the collection.
Dont forget to write a module header similar to the one in TIMER.mod.
